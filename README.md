# 🙋‍♀ Hi, I’m Amanda!
I'm an aspiring data analyst, with a background in accounting, having spent 5 years as an auditor. My experience has sharpened my analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to draw meaningful insights from complex data. Over time, I developed a keen interest in the way data analytic tools can be used to handle complex data much easily and is so much more than just data extraction and data cleaning.

As I transition into data analytics, I have developed expertise in:

🛠️ Tools & Technologies: SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and Tableau <br/>
📊 Skills: Data visualization, statistical analysis, and business intelligence reporting <br/>

I'm passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive better decision-making. Check out my repositories for projects that showcase my journey in data analytics, including case studies and hands-on analyses.

Feel free to connect with me or collaborate on a project!
